rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_1	PERFORM_RITUAL	Keepsake of Gazul's Favoured	This keepsake once belonged to a mighty warrior who sought to eradicate defilers of the dead in the name of the Lord of Underearth, Gazul himself. Its loss has been a subject of great shame said to be felt even by the Ancestors, whose souls will not be appeased until it is back in Dawi hands.	dwf/generic	event_province_positive.png	false	false	Grudges		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false
rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_2	PERFORM_RITUAL	Morgrim's Gears of War	By Morgrim's teachings, the craftsmanship displayed with these sacred gears, legendary paradigms of Dwarfen engineering, are of the highest echelons. The knowledge set by their standard is sacred, so the revered instruments must be recovered and preserved for future generations of Dawi.	dwf/generic	event_province_positive.png	false	false	Grudges		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false
rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_3	PERFORM_RITUAL	Raton's Collar of Bestial Control	In his time, Raton proposed dangerous and radical ideas to gain control over primitive beasts. With the help of the Engineers' Guild, he developed a prototype collar that apparently worked, but was slain while binding it to a beast subject. Now long lost, this item’s efficacy could further prove Dwarf engineering’s supremacy over magic.	dwf/generic	event_province_positive.png	false	false	Grudges		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false
rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_4	PERFORM_RITUAL	Smednir's Metallurgy Cipher	It is no doubt that Smednir’s smelting techniques made us the most renowned metalworkers in the world. Many of his most important formulae were lost during the many upheavals of the Dwarfen dynasties, likely stolen by those without understanding of what they took. Without Smednir’s lost secrets, the Dawi can never be as great as they are destined to be!	dwf/generic	event_province_positive.png	false	false	Grudges		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false
rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_5	PERFORM_RITUAL	Thungni's Tongs of the Runesmith	Thungni’s Tongs were utilised by some of the first Runesmiths under his tutelage, serving them well in crafting the most potent rune-weapons ever made. These powerful armaments were crucial in many of the great victories of our kin – such weapons could be forged again, but not without the tongs that gave them their power, long lost in the mists of time.	dwf/generic	event_province_positive.png	false	false	Grudges		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false
rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_6	PERFORM_RITUAL	Beard Rings of Grimnir	Grimnir the Fearless is the patron of warriors. These exotic Beard Rings masterfully crafted in his name once belonged to one of his deadliest Slayer Clerics but have long been lost. Should they be recovered, the Slayers of the Brotherhood of Grimnir will be left with only the reason for their oaths of which to feel ashamed.	dwf/generic	event_province_positive.png	false	false	Grudges		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false
rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_7	PERFORM_RITUAL	Blessed Pick of Grungni	Grungni, the mighty Allfather of the Dawi, taught our Ancestors the very skills that have assured our survival for centuries. This pick is a holy relic crafted in his honour by the oldest of the Dawi, and the Longbeards will not be appeased until it is recovered.	dwf/generic	event_province_positive.png	false	false	Grudges		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false

rhox_iee_lccp_tze_blue_scribes_stage_1_nor	CAPTURE_X_BATTLE_CAPTIVES	Parchment & Ink	Parchment has been seen falling from the skies over nearby battlefields. The scribblings upon them bind powerful magics into the pages, waiting to be unlocked by any who might claim them. Where they came from or why they litter the fields of war remains a mystery, yet one thing is for certain: every word brims with the Changer's arcane power. If the culprits behind this flurry of spells are ever to be located, questions must be asked. Perhaps those captured in battle may have tales to tell us?	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false

rhox_iee_lccp_tze_blue_scribes_stage_2_nor	CAPTURE_REGIONS	Parchment & Ink	Your investigation has proven fruitful, indeed. It seems the Blue Scribes of Tzeentch – P'tarix and Xirat'p – are the frenzied force behind the haphazard magics that have plagued so many battlefields across the land. Better yet, a clue to their current location has now reared its head, as Chaos surges within a nearby settlement. If you act quickly, you could capture the region before the Blue Scribes have chance to move on, spreading their twisted mischief further outside of your reach.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false
rhox_iee_lccp_tze_blue_scribes_stage_3_nor	CONSTRUCT_N_BUILDINGS_INCLUDING	Parchment & Ink	The Blue Scribes may have just slipped your grasp, but a show of force is not the only way to entice them to your side. They have been given an impossible task in recording every fragment of magic they can find, for the possibilities have multiplied in mortal hands. Perhaps the Shamans of Chaos could offer these Wandering Wizards with assistance, and provide them a place in the mortal realm capable of housing their surplus spells.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false
rhox_iee_lccp_tze_aekold_helbrass_stage_1_nor	CONSTRUCT_N_BUILDINGS_INCLUDING	A Tale of the True Path	Word has spread of a noble’s son, a once-great Knight of the Empire, who roams the Chaos Wastes in search of a greater purpose. Most remarkably he bears the insignia of a Tzeentchian cult, the Brethren of the Golden Eagle. His loyalties had him pursued doggedly for a time by the Templars of Sigmar, the Empire’s Witch Hunters, but once they caught up he proved his status as the greatest swordsman in his Knightly Order. Perhaps in time this Champion-in-the-making will make his way to us, but in the meantime we must ensure there are more like-minded warriors to help him embrace Chaos.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false
