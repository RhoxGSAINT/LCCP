missions_localised_title_rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_1	Keepsake of Gazul's Favoured	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_1	This keepsake once belonged to a mighty warrior who sought to eradicate defilers of the dead in the name of the Lord of Underearth, Gazul himself. Its loss has been a subject of great shame said to be felt even by the Ancestors, whose souls will not be appeased until it is back in Dawi hands.	false
missions_localised_title_rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_2	Morgrim's Gears of War	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_2	By Morgrim's teachings, the craftsmanship displayed with these sacred gears, legendary paradigms of Dwarfen engineering, are of the highest echelons. The knowledge set by their standard is sacred, so the revered instruments must be recovered and preserved for future generations of Dawi.	false
missions_localised_title_rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_3	Raton's Collar of Bestial Control	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_3	In his time, Raton proposed dangerous and radical ideas to gain control over primitive beasts. With the help of the Engineers' Guild, he developed a prototype collar that apparently worked, but was slain while binding it to a beast subject.

missions_localised_title_rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_4	Smednir's Metallurgy Cipher	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_4	It is no doubt that Smednir’s smelting techniques made us the most renowned metalworkers in the world. Many of his most important formulae were lost during the many upheavals of the Dwarfen dynasties, likely stolen by those without understanding of what they took. Without Smednir’s lost secrets, the Dawi can never be as great as they are destined to be!	false

missions_localised_description_rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_5	Thungni’s Tongs were utilised by some of the first Runesmiths under his tutelage, serving them well in crafting the most potent rune-weapons ever made.

missions_localised_title_rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_7	Blessed Pick of Grungni	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_burlok_ritual_burlok_artifact_7	Grungni, the mighty Allfather of the Dawi, taught our Ancestors the very skills that have assured our survival for centuries. This pick is a holy relic crafted in his honour by the oldest of the Dawi, and the Longbeards will not be appeased until it is recovered.	false

missions_localised_description_rhox_iee_lccp_tze_blue_scribes_stage_1_nor	Parchment has been seen falling from the skies over nearby battlefields. The scribblings upon them bind powerful magics into the pages, waiting to be unlocked by any who might claim them. Where they came from or why they litter the fields of war remains a mystery, yet one thing is for certain: every word brims with the Changer's arcane power. If the culprits behind this flurry of spells are ever to be located, questions must be asked. Perhaps those captured in battle may have tales to tell us?	false

missions_localised_description_rhox_iee_lccp_tze_blue_scribes_stage_2_nor	Your investigation has proven fruitful, indeed. It seems the Blue Scribes of Tzeentch – P'tarix and Xirat'p – are the frenzied force behind the haphazard magics that have plagued so many battlefields across the land. Better yet, a clue to their current location has now reared its head, as Chaos surges within a nearby settlement. If you act quickly, you could capture the region before the Blue Scribes have chance to move on, spreading their twisted mischief further outside of your reach.	false

missions_localised_description_rhox_iee_lccp_tze_aekold_helbrass_stage_1_nor	Word has spread of a noble’s son, a once-great Knight of the Empire, who roams the Chaos Wastes in search of a greater purpose. Most remarkably he bears the insignia of a Tzeentchian cult, the Brethren of the Golden Eagle. His loyalties had him pursued doggedly for a time by the Templars of Sigmar, the Empire’s Witch Hunters, but once they caught up he proved his status as the greatest swordsman in his Knightly Order. Perhaps in time this Champion-in-the-making will make his way to us, but in the meantime we must ensure there are more like-minded warriors to help him embrace Chaos.	false
